# 🧬 Diabetes Dataset - Machine Learning Prediction

This repository is a continuation of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. After cleaning and preparing the data in the [EDA repository](https://github.com/nimaski/pima-diabetes-eda), this project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset in female patients of Pima Indian heritage.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (UCI ML Repository)
- **Samples:** 768 female patients
- **Features:** 8 health metrics (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Age)
- **Target Variable:** `0` (No Diabetes) / `1` (Diabetes)

## 🧠 Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction

After preparing the dataset, we implemented multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes.

### 🔢 Modeling Workflow:
1. **Feature and Target Separation**
2. **Train-Test Split**
3. **Feature Scaling (Standardization)**
4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Random Forest Classifier
5. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
6. **Model Comparison & Conclusion**
